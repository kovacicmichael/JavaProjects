/**
 * 11.	Write a class named Assignment11 that 
 *  uses a double for-loop (a for-loop within a for-loop). 
 *  The outer loop should navigate through an integer array 
 *  that has 10 elements corresponding to the numbers 1 through 10, inclusive. 
 *  The inner loop should count from 1 to 10, and prints the value of the 
 *  current count multiplied by the current index of the array. 
 *  You should end up printing the multiples of 1 through 10 from 1 to 10. 
 *  Ex: 1*1, 1*2, 1*3…1*10, 2*1, 2*2, 2*3…10*9, 10*10.
